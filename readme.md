# Firebase Functions Backend

This repository contains the backend logic for your application, implemented using Firebase Functions. Follow the instructions below to set up and use the backend.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Firebase CLI**: Ensure you have the Firebase CLI installed. If not, you can install it by running:

   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).

---

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo-directory>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the Firebase Functions emulator:

   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```

4. Once the emulator is running, youâ€™ll see a **Base URL** in the Firebase CLI logs. Use this URL as the base for all API calls (e.g., `http://localhost:5001/<your-project-id>/us-central1/<function-name>`).
